Description: A Bayesian approach to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases from incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks. 'NobBS' learns the reporting delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve to produce smoothed nowcasts in both stable and time-varying case reporting settings, as described in McGough et al. (2019) <doi:10.1101/663823>.  
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
